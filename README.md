My personal emacs config.

# about
This is my personal emacs configuration.
I wanted to build my emacs init.el file, so I know everything about it.
Hopefully I can also just add more emacs stuff in general to this repository.
I will add more it is currently it is good version for beginners I do not think it is too commplicated and I added a lot of comments for a beginner in emacs to start somewhere.
